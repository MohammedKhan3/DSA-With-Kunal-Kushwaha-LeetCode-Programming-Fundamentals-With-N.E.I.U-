# LeetCode Solutions & Programming Fundamentals
Welcome to my GitHub repository, where I delve into the world of competitive programming and computer science fundamentals. This repository serves as a comprehensive guide and personal journey through various LeetCode problems, encapsulating my unique approaches and solutions. Alongside, I share valuable theory notes inspired by Kunal Kushwaha, aiming to solidify the understanding of core programming concepts.

# What's Inside

 LeetCode Solutions: Dive into my solutions for a wide range of LeetCode problems. Each solution is accompanied by a detailed explanation of my thought process and the strategies I employed to tackle the challenges.

 Theory Notes: Benefit from the distilled wisdom of Kunal Kushwaha. These notes cover essential programming theories and concepts, structured to enhance your learning and retention.

Programming Fundamentals: A section dedicated to the foundational elements of programming, learned through my academic journey at Northeastern Illinois University (NEIU). From basic syntax to advanced algorithms, these fundamentals are the building blocks of my problem-solving arsenal.

# How to Use This Repository
For Learning: If you're new to programming or looking to brush up on your skills, start with the programming fundamentals section and theory notes. They provide a solid groundwork before diving into problem-solving.
