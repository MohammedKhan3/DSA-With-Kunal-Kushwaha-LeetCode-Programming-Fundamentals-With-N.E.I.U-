Write a program that has the class name Problem2 and that has the main method.
● Write a second method named evenlySpaced that takes three integer parameters, a, b,
and c.
● One of the integers is the smallest, one integer is largest, and one is in between the other
two. Return true if the three values are evenly spaced, so the difference between small
and medium is the same as the difference between medium and large. Otherwise, return
false. You can assume that the three integers will be unique values.
● Several sample method calls are provided for you below. You should test your method
inside the main method.

public class Problem2 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(evenlySpaced(2,4,6)); 
    }
    public static boolean evenlySpaced(int a, int b, int c) {
        int max = Math.max(a, Math.max(b, c));
        int min = Math.min(a, Math.min(b, c));
        int mid = a + b + c - max - min;

        return (max - mid) == (mid - min);
    }
}
